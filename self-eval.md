# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? THere were moments of trouble and success... The unicorn and vampire portion I felt pretty solid on. Past that I was pretty confused. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? I'm getting there... I am pretty good at losing track of time and wasting 3 hours doing something that is probably not worth the time it took. But slow and steady progress
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Perseverence is key, and it is okay to ask for help. I reached out to a friend who completed Turing a few years ago for help on this assignment and he was quite helpful.
